# Electron Projects

I'll use this folder to store my projects made with Electron. 

The first project will be the tutorial and the next will be a program that runs a youtube window that plays Lo-fi musics radio like [this of the ChilledCow](https://www.youtube.com/embed/5qap5aO4i9A).

## Introduction to Electron JS

Electron JS is a tool that let us create a desktop project using the same languages of the web (HTML, CSS and JS), so we can re-use our knowledge to develop those solutions faster.
